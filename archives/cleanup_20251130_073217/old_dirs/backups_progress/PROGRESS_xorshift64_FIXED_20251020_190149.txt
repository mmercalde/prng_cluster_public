=== MAJOR FIX: xorshift64 Output Bug Fixed ===
Date: October 20, 2025
Timestamp: ${TIMESTAMP}

BUG FOUND AND FIXED:
- xorshift64 kernel was using (state & 0xFFFFFFFF) % 1000 (32-bit truncation)
- Test data was using state % 1000 (full 64-bit)
- This caused 0% match rate

FIXES APPLIED:
✅ Changed kernel output to: unsigned long long output = state;
✅ xorshift64 forward now finds seed 1234 with 100% match
✅ All dtype issues resolved (uint32 → uint64)
✅ sieve_filter.py hybrid section fixed

VERIFIED WORKING:
✅ philox4x32_reverse: 100% match
✅ xorshift64 forward: 100% match

NEXT: Test xorshift64_reverse and check java_lcg for same bug
